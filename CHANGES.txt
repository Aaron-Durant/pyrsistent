TODO (in no particular order)
-----------------------------
- Python 3 compatibility
- More convenience methods to simplify work with these data structures.
- Create optimized function for replacing multiple elements in the same function call (massoc) that can
  also be used by the PMap, "merge into".
- Implement persistent linked list (cons, cdr, ...)
- Versioned data structure where the different versions can be accessed by index?
- Improve documentation
- Recursive instantiation from nested lists/tuples/sets/maps
- Check pickling
- More features on immutable object
