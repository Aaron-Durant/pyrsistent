v0.4.0, 2014-09-20 -- * Full Python 3 support.
                      * Immutable object implemented.
                      * Bug fixes in PVector.__repr__() and PMap.__hash__() and index check of PVector.
                      * Repr changed to be fully cut and paste compatible
                      * Changed assoc() -> set(), assoc_in() -> set_in(), massoc() -> mset().
                        Sorry for the API breaking change but I think those names are more pythonic.
                      * Improved documentation.
v0.3.1, 2014-06-29 -- * assoc() on PSet renamed back to add()
v0.3.0, 2014-06-28 -- * Full Sequence protocol support for PVector
                      * Full Mapping protocol support for PMap
                      * Full Set protocol support for PSet
                      * assoc_in() support for both PMap and PVector
                      * merge() support for PMap
                      * Performance improvements to the PVector C extension speed up allocation
v0.2.1, 2014-06-21 -- Supply the tests with the distribution
v0.2.0, 2014-06-21 -- * New C extension with an optimized version of the persistent vector
                      * Updated API slightly
v0.1.0, 2013-11-10 -- Initial release.

TODO (in no particular order)
-----------------------------
- More convenience methods to simplify work with these data structures.
- Create optimized function for replacing multiple elements in the same function call (massoc) that can
  also be used by the PMap, "merge into".
- Implement persistent linked list (cons, cdr, ...)
- Versioned data structure where the different versions can be accessed by index?
- Ordered sets and maps?
- Recursive instantiation from nested lists/tuples/sets/maps (is this a good or just messy idea?)
- Check pickling
