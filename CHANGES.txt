TODO (in no particular order)
-----------------------------
- Python 3 compatibility
- More convinience methods to simplify work with these data structures.
- PVector contains, count (fully support Sequence protocol)
- Create automated memory leak tests (eg. check memory usage, run for a while and check it again)
- Create optimized function for replacing multiple elements in the same function call (massoc) that can
  also be used by the PMap, "merge into".
- Register pvectorc with Hashable
- Implement persistent linked list (cons, cdr, ...)
- Versioned data structure where the different versions can be accessed by index?
- Improve documentation + add doctests
- TUX + Travis for multi platform continuous test?
- Recursive instantiation from nested lists/tuples/sets/maps
